# Code Challenge Wipro Front-end

This repository contains the technical test to Wipro admission.

## How to do it

This challenge consists in 2 steps:

  * Functions: You must solve some issues using common `js`.
  * React: You have to make a view using React. The environment is already configured, so you must follow the instructions to make the view with due requisites specified in tests.

Inside each directory challenge (`challenge-functions` and `challenge-functions`) have a description to how to solve them, go and explore them.

## After complete

Notify your recruiter that you solve all challenges.
